## Impact of Unified Scoring

The implementation of unified relevance scoring provides:

1. **Fair Comparison:** Both systems now use identical 0-3 scale scoring logic
2. **Consistent Evaluation:** Same relevance calculation across question types
3. **Transparent Metrics:** Clear understanding of how scores are derived
4. **Reproducible Results:** Standardized approach enables reliable benchmarking

## Strategic Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Production Deployment:** Use Dataverse for production due to reliability
2. **Capacity Planning:** Address Agentic search throttling and rate limiting issues
3. **Performance Monitoring:** Implement monitoring for both systems using unified metrics

### Long-term Strategy
1. **Hybrid Approach:** Consider using Agentic for specific question types where it excels
2. **Infrastructure Investment:** Improve Agentic search capacity and reliability
3. **Continuous Evaluation:** Regular benchmarking using the unified scoring framework

## Conclusion

While both systems show comparable relevance performance when functioning optimally, **Dataverse emerges as the clear choice for production deployment** due to:

- Higher reliability (86.9% vs 40.3% success rate)
- Consistent performance across all question types
- No capacity or throttling limitations
- Balanced precision and recall metrics

The unified scoring logic ensures this conclusion is based on fair, standardized evaluation criteria rather than system-specific biases.
