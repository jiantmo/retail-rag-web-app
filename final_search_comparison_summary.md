### Dataverse Search Strengths
- **Consistent Reliability:** 86.9% success rate across all question types
- **No Throttling Issues:** Handles full query volume without capacity problems
- **Balanced Performance:** Reasonable scores across all question types
- **Better Category-only Queries:** Handles broad category searches well

### The Throttling Problem
- **59.4% of Agentic requests were throttled**, severely limiting evaluation
- When successful, Agentic shows **dramatically superior relevance performance**
- Throttling masks Agentic's true potential in production scenarios

## Strategic Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Address Agentic Throttling:** Critical infrastructure investment needed
2. **Hybrid Strategy:** Use Agentic for specific high-value query types
3. **Capacity Planning:** Scale Agentic infrastructure to handle production load

### Production Deployment Strategy

#### Option 1: Reliability-First (Current Dataverse)
- **Pros:** Consistent performance, no throttling, handles all query types
- **Cons:** Lower relevance scores, especially for complex attribute/price queries
- **Best for:** Scenarios where uptime > relevance quality

#### Option 2: Quality-First (Future Agentic)  
- **Pros:** Superior relevance performance when functioning
- **Cons:** Requires significant infrastructure investment
- **Best for:** Scenarios where relevance quality > cost constraints

#### Option 3: Hybrid Approach (Recommended)
- **Exact Word + Category+Attribute + Category+Price:** Route to Agentic
- **Category + Description:** Route to Dataverse  
- **Fallback:** Always use Dataverse if Agentic throttled
- **Benefits:** Best of both systems with risk mitigation

## Conclusion

The corrected scoring logic reveals that **Agentic search significantly outperforms Dataverse in relevance quality** for most query types. However, the **59.4% throttling rate** makes it currently unsuitable for production without infrastructure improvements.

**Key Decision Factors:**
- If reliability is paramount → Choose Dataverse
- If relevance quality is paramount → Invest in Agentic infrastructure  
- If balanced approach needed → Implement hybrid routing

The proper scoring logic following `SCORING_LOGIC_SUMMARY.md` provides a more accurate and fair evaluation, showing that investment in Agentic search infrastructure could yield significant improvements in search relevance quality.
